/* The CSS code `*{ margin: 0; padding: 0; }` is a CSS reset. It sets the margin and padding of all
elements on the page to 0, effectively removing any default spacing that may be applied by the
browser. This is often used as a starting point for CSS stylesheets to ensure consistent styling
across different browsers. */
